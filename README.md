# Resonate 2015 OpenGL Workshop

In here, you'll find the example projects for the _Realtime or it Didn't Happen_ workshop, held at [Resonate 2015][res15] by Arturo Castro ([@arturoc][arturoc], James Acres ([@jacres][jacres]), and Tim Gfrerer ([@tgfrerer][tgfrerer]).

## Structure

Each example exists in two versions: 

* *startingPoint* -- where we set off at the workshop
* *complete* -- the finished, worked example

Each example directory contains a screenshot.png which shows a view of the worked out example. 

Some examples have Readme.md files with additional information.

## Project files

Each example directory also contains project files for Visual Studio 2012 and XCode. If you are running these examples in other development environments, you may want to use the openFrameworks project generator to create the project files for your system.

## License

We're releasing these examples, unless otherwise stated, under the MIT license.

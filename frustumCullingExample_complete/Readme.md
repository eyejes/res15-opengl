# Sphere - Frustum Culling

This app demonstrates how to cull spheres against a camera frustum. 

There are two cameras in the scene. 

100 Spheres will be culled against the frustum of camera 0. 

You initially watch the scene through camera 1. Spheres culled from camera 0's frustum are drawn in red, spheres within camera 0's frustum are drawn white.

Press `c` to toggle between the two cameras. Use the mouse to adjust the camera through which you view the scene.
